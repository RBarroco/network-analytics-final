The following intrusions are simulated in the data set:

• TCP-SYN Flood: A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack where attackers target hosts by initiating many Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) handshake processes without waiting for the response from the target node. By doing so, the target device’s resources are consumed as it has to keep allocating some memory space for every new TCP request.

• Port scan: An attack in which attackers scan available ports on a host device in order to learn information abou the services, versions, and even security mechanisms that are running on that host.

• Flow Table Overflow: An attack that targets network switches/routers where attacks compromise the functionality of a switch/router by consuming the flow tables that forward packets with illegitimate flow entries and rules so that legitimate flow entries and rules cannot be installed.

• Blackhole: An attack that targets network switches/ routers to discard the packets that pass through, instead of relaying them on to the next hop.

• Traffic Diversion: A attack that targets network switches/ routers to reroute the direction of packets away from their destination, with the goal of increasing travel time and/or to spy on network traffic through a man-in-themiddle scenario.


These intrusion types were selected for this dataset as they are common cyber attacks that can occur in any networking environment. Also, these intrusion types cover attacks that can be launched on both network devices and end hosts.
