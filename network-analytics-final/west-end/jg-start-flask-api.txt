~/git_repos/final_project/front-end/app$ npm run start-flask-api; localhost:5000

~/git_repos/final_project/front-end/app npm start app; localhost:3000


export FLASK_APP=api.py  # to tell flask where to run? set an environment variable in that terminal
echo $FLASK_APP # to check if flask is associated with the file that runs the application. <api.py> is the file with the flask app.
# another alternative not used: FLASK_APP=api.py flask db init

now we have to create a docker image.  and check ec2.
